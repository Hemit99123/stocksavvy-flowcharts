## ðŸ”‘ Sessions

The sessions are used to keep track of user information and authentication status in an application. They are stored in a database which in our case is Redis. We use Redis Hashes and RediSearch modules on top of the basic Redis technology.

### Why Redis?

- Fast speeds due to in-server memory
- Quick retrivals due to their software design
- No memory lost concerns as users can simply log back in if data is lost (server crashes). No critical data at stake


The sessions are stored in the form of a Redis hash so we can target a speific field (email, name, etc), This diagram will explain the structuring of the Redis digram visually and more in-depth:

    Session <|-- idxSession

    class Session {
        +String name
        +User | Admin role
        +String email
    }

    class idxSession {
        +String name
    }
```

The idxSession (idx:session) is an index which allows RediSearch to search for a session keyname through the name field (useful for **RACT CLI TOOL**)
