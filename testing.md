## ðŸ§ª Testing

There are 2 types of testing that are implemented within our software systems:

### - Unit Testing:
Unit testing is a way of testing the smallest blocks of code called **units.** Some examples of units are functions, methods, classes, and many more. 

### - Integration Testing:
Unlike unit testing, integration tests are test ran on a software that encompasses multiple different units that work in unison as a single entity. Examples include controllers for backend as they use Express (seperate piece of code with it's own set of units) to produce a response.

This requires more development time to build these tests. So, why are they worth it?

### Benefits to implementing a unit testing solution

- allows for early error detection
- up to date documentation on the different units in the program
- improves quality of code by detecting any error-prone function

The following workflow describes how the unit testing would be implementing into our CI/CD pipeline. We have decided to implement the unit tests checks in Github Actions rather than Husky (pre-commit) due to two **core** reasons:

-  You want to run your tests in the same environment where you build your deliverables (deployed application). Pre-commits run the tests on the local environment which could be configured differently causing it to pass locally but fail on production server.

- Tests can be computationally expensive. Running them on a personal computer might cause performance issues.
